# softwareKG
This repository accompanies the publication "Investigating software usage in the social sciences with SoftwareKG"

Currently this repository contains the code in its raw form. 
There are still some changes necessary to make the code better usable:
1. create requirements.txt for easy pip set up
2. resolve dependency conflicts between Snorkel env. and Tensorflow env. (two separate environments might be necessary to run the code in `silver_standard_generation` and `entity_extraction`.)
3. double check all relative paths in the project. 
4. refactoring and making the code easier readable
